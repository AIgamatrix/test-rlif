To simplify this expression further, we can rationalize the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\lambda_{\\text{red}}}{1 - \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\lambda_{\\text{red}} (1 + \\sqrt{2})}{(1 - \\sqrt{2})(1 + \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\lambda_{\\text{red}} (1 + \\sqrt{2})}{1 - 2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\lambda_{\\text{red}} (1 + \\sqrt{2})}{-1} = -\\sqrt{2} \\lambda_{\\text{red}} (1 + \\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2} \\lambda_{\\text{red}} - 2 \\lambda_{\\text{red}} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} (-\\sqrt{2} - 2)\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with wavelengths, which are positive quantities, we should consider the positive value of the expression. The correct simplified form is:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda^{\\prime} = \\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{3 + 2\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer for the wavelength of the light Manny sees is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\lambda_{\\text{red}} \\sqrt{3 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]",

      "model_response": "To determine the age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed, we need to use the concept of the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The key idea is that the universe was in a hot and dense state when the temperature dropped to a certain point, and then it cooled down to the current temperature. One important piece of information we need is the temperature at which the universe became transparent to light, which is approximately 3000 Kelvin.\n\nThe age of the universe at the time of decoupling (when the universe became transparent to light) can be estimated using the formula for the age of the universe in terms of the temperature and the expansion rate of the universe. However, for simplicity, we can use a known result from cosmology that the age of the universe at the time of decoupling is approximately 138 million years.\n\nTo express this age in minutes, we need to convert years to minutes. There are 365.25 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, and 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, the conversion factor from years to minutes is:\n\n\\[ 1 \\text{ year} = 365.25 \\text{ days/year} \\times 24 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 525960 \\text{ minutes/year} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the age of the universe in minutes:\n\n\\[ 138 \\text{ million years} = 138 \\times 10^6 \\text{ years} \\]\n\\[ 138 \\times 10^6 \\text{ years} \\times 525960 \\text{ minutes/year} = 7.22 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest power of 10, we get:\n\n\\[ 7.22 \\times 10^{14} \\approx 7 \\times 10^{14} \\]\n\nTherefore, the age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed is approximately \\(\\boxed{7 \\times 10^{14}}\\) minutes.",

Each digit (0 through 9) requires a different amount of paint. Specifically, the amount of paint required for each digit is as follows: 1 unit for 1, 2 units for 2, 3 units for 3, ..., 10 units for 9, and 1 unit for 0. How many total units of paint are needed to repaint all the house numbers?\nTo determine the total amount of paint needed to repaint all the house numbers from 1 to 100, we need to calculate the paint required for each digit from 0 to 9 and then sum it up for all the house numbers.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1.

The field's length is to be twice its width. The school committee has allocated a budget for the field's construction, which includes a fixed cost of $10,000 for the land and an additional cost proportional to the perimeter of the field. If the total budget for the construction is $20,000, find the dimensions of the field.\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of a rectangular field where the length is twice the width, and the total cost of construction is $20,000. The cost includes a fixed cost of $10,000 for the land and an additional cost proportional to the perimeter of the field.\n\nLet's break down the problem into manageable steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the width of the field.\n   - Then the length \\( l \\) of the field is \\( 2w \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter \\( P \\) of the rectangle is given by \\( P = 2(l + w) = 2(2w + w) = 6w \\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Cost Equation:**\n   - The total cost \\( C \\) is the sum of the fixed cost and the cost proportional to the perimeter. Let \\( k \\) be the cost per unit length of the perimeter. Then the total cost is \\( C = 10,000 + k \\cdot 6w \\).\n   - We know that the total budget is $20,000, so we can set up the equation \\( 10,000 + k \\cdot 6w = 20,000 \\).\n\n4. **Solve for \\( w \\):**\n   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( w \\): \\( k \\cdot 6w = 10,000 \\).\n   - Since \\( k \\) is the cost per unit length of the perimeter, we can assume \\( k = 1000 \\) (since the total budget for the field is $20,000 and the fixed cost is $10,000, the remaining $10,000 is the cost proportional to the perimeter). So, \\( 1000 \\cdot 6w = 10,000 \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\( 6000w = 10,000 \\), so \\( w = \\frac{10,000}{6000} = \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\n5. **Find the Length:**\n   - The length \\( l \\) is \\( 2w = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} \\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy to verify our solution:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nw = sp.symbols('w')\n\n# Define the cost equation\nk = 1000  # cost per unit length of the perimeter\ntotal_cost = 10000 + k * 6 * w\nbudget = 20000\n\n# Solve the equation for w\nsolution = sp.solve(total_cost - budget, w)\nwidth = solution[0]\nlength = 2 * width\n\nprint(f\"Width: {width}, Length: {length",

      "correct_answer": "8.64",
      "model_response": "To calculate the density of copper at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we need to use the formula for density, which is $\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $m$ is the mass, and $V$ is the volume. However, since we are given the lattice constant and not the atomic mass or the number of atoms per unit volume, we will use a different approach.\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of the unit cell. The unit cell of copper is a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. The volume of an FCC unit cell can be calculated using the lattice constant $a$ as $V = a^3$. Given $a = 3.655 \\AA$, we convert $\\AA$ to $cm$ by multiplying by $10^{-8}$ (since $1 \\AA = 10^{-8} cm$), so $a = 3.655 \\times 10^{-8} cm$. Therefore, the volume of the unit cell is $V = (3.655 \\times 10^{-8} cm)^3$.\n\nNext, we need to find the mass of the unit cell. The atomic mass of copper is approximately $63.55 g/mol$. In an FCC structure, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. Therefore, the mass of the unit cell is $m = 4 \\times \\frac{63.55 g}{6.022 \\times 10^{23}}$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the density as $\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$. Substituting the values we found for $m$ and $V$, we get $\\rho = \\frac{4 \\times \\frac{63.55 g}{6.022 \\times 10^{23}}}{(3.655 \\times 10^{-8} cm)^3}$.

The mass of one atom of vanadium is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mass of one atom} = \\frac{50.94 \\text{ g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ atoms/mol}} = 8.46 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ g}\n   \\]\n   The mass of the unit cell is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mass of the unit cell} = 2 \\times 8.46 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ g} = 1.69 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ g}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the density of vanadium:**\n   The density \\(\\rho\\) is given by the mass of the unit cell divided by the volume of the unit cell:\n   \\[\n   \\rho = \\frac{1.69 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ g}}{2.38 \\times 10^{-29} \\text{ m}^3} = 7.08 \\times 10^6 \\text{ g/m}^3\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the highest linear density of atoms:**\n   The highest linear density of atoms is the number of atoms per unit length of the unit cell. The edge length of the unit cell is \\(287.6 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}\\), and the unit cell contains 2 atoms along each edge. Therefore, the highest linear density is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Highest linear density} = \\frac{2 \\text{ atoms}}{287.6 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}} = 6.96 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ atoms/m}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the highest linear density of atoms in vanadium is \\(\\boxed{6.96 \\times 10^{10}}\\) atoms/m.",

The profit function, \\(\\pi\\), is given by the difference between total revenue, \\(R\\), and total cost, \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\pi = R - C\n\\]\n\nIn the short-term, the capital (or fixed) cost, \\(C_K\\), is a constant and does not change with the level of output. Therefore, the profit function can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\pi = P \\cdot Q - (C_L + C_K)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(P\\) is the price of the output, \\(Q\\) is the quantity of output, \\(C_L\\) is the variable cost, and \\(C_K\\) is the fixed cost. Since \\(C_K\\) is a constant, it does not affect the optimization of the firm's profit. Thus, we can focus on the variable cost and revenue terms.\n\nTo maximize profit, we need to find the level of output, \\(Q\\), that maximizes the profit function.

The raising operator $\\mathbf{J}^+$ raises the $M$ quantum number by 1, and the lowering operator $\\mathbf{J}^-$ lowers the $M$ quantum number by 1.\n\nLet's solve the first integral:\n\\[\n\\int \\psi_{22}^{*}\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{J}}^{+}\\right)^{4} \\psi_{2,-2} d \\tau\n\\]\n\nUsing the properties of the spherical harmonics, we can see that:\n\\[\n\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{J}}^{+}\\right)^{4} Y_{22} = \\left(\\mathbf{J}^+\\right)^4 Y_{22} = \\hbar^4 \\sqrt{(2-2)(2+2+1)} \\sqrt{(2+2)(2-2+1)} \\sqrt{(2+1)(2-1+1)} \\sqrt{(2+1)(2-1+1)} Y_{22} = 0\n\\]\n\nSince the result of the raising operator acting on $Y_{22}$ is zero, the integral is zero.\n\nNow let's solve the second integral:\n\\[\n\\int \\psi_{2,-2}^{*}\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{J}}^{-}\\right)^{5} \\psi_{22} d \\tau\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, we can see that:\n\\[\n\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{J}}^{-}\\right)^{5} Y_{22} = \\left(\\mathbf{J}^-\\right)^5 Y_{22} = \\hbar^5 \\sqrt{(2+2)(2-2+1)} \\sqrt{(2-2)(2+2+1)} \\sqrt{(2-1)(2+1+1)} \\sqrt{(2-1)(2+1+1)} \\sqrt{(2-1)(2+1+1)} Y_{22} = 0\n\\]\n\nSince the result of the lowering operator acting on $Y_{22}$ is zero, the integral is zero.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nLet's confirm this with Python code using sympy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the spherical harmonics\nJ, M = sp.symbols('J M')\nY_JM = sp.Function('Y')(J, M)\n\n# Define the raising and lowering operators\nJ_plus = sp.Function('J_plus')(J, M)\nJ_minus = sp.Function('J_minus')(J, M)\n\n# Define the integrals\nintegral1 = sp.integrate(Y_JM.subs(M, 2) * J_plus**4 * Y_JM.subs(M, -2), (J, 2, 2))\nintegral2 = sp.integrate(Y_JM.subs(M, -2) * J_minus**5 * Y_JM.subs(M, 2), (J, 2, 2))\n\n# Simplify the integrals\nintegral1 = sp.simplify(integral1)\nintegral2 = sp.simplify(integral2)\n\nprint(integral1)\nprint(integral2)\n```",
